# CVFS
It is a virtual file system which is a customized version of the operating system's file system the only difference is my file system can run on any platform such as windows,linux,mac-os . In real time file system in an OS stores or creates the files inside hard disk but CVFS creates the file's on the RAM this means the files are temporary.
